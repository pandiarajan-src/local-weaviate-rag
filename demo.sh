SAMPLE_TEXT="Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks and are used to estimate functions that depend on a large number of generally unknown inputs."
